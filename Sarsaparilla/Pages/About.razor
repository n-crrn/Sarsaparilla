        <p>
            Sarsaparilla is a test platform for a number of formal logic algorithms
            associated with representing stateful security protocols. It stands for
            "State Aware Research Studying All Protocols' Authoritative Representation
            In Latest Logic Analyser."
        </p>

        <p>
            Sarsaparilla supports a subset of the ProVerif Specification Language
            (dialect of Applied π-Calculus) used by
            <a href='https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/'>ProVerif</a>.
            Models written this way are translated into Stateful Horn Clauses, and
            can be input on the <a href='/pi'>π-Model Page</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Inputting a π-Model</h2>

        <p>
            The <a href='/pi'>π-Model Page</a> page has three sections:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Model Editor</dt>
            <dd>
                This section allows you to input a model to Sarsaparilla. There are
                facilities for loading or saving models to or from your computer.
                There is also a small selection of sample models.
            </dd>

            <dt>Compiled Model Details</dt>
            <dd>
                This section details a basic outline of the in-memory representation
                of the model and the term-resolved representation of the model.
                It also provides a full listing of the Stateful Horn Clause
                translation of the π-Calculus model.
            </dd>

            <dt>Query Result</dt>
            <dd>
                This section provides the result of any attempt at leak detection.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Each section can be minimised or maximised by using the corresponding
            buttons horizontally aligned with its section header. An example of
            the screen is illustrated below.
        </p>

        <p>
            The quickest way to start with Sarsaparilla is to follow the three
            green steps indicated on the above diagram.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Select a sample and click the 'Overwrite' button to load it into the
                editor field.
            </li>

            <li>
                Click the 'Compile' button to create the in-memory model and 
                create the translation to Stateful Horn Clauses.
            </li>

            <li>
                Click the 'Query' button to see if the specified messages are leaked.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If the leak is detected, a read-out linking the leaked message to the
            rules leading to it is provided as per below. Unfortunately, at this time
            there is no way to directly link attacks to π-Model processes.

        <h2>Directly Using Stateful Horn Clauses</h2>

        <p>
            Stateful Horn Clauses can be used directly with Sarsaparilla. They are
            input on the <a href='/horn'>Horn Clause page</a>.
